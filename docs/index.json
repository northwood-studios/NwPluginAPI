    "keywords": "Plugin prerequisites The Plugin Class WARNING: Your plugin must have a Plugin class. The Plugin class is the main class of your plugin. It contains the entry point of your plugin and is used to initialize your plugin. It is typically named either Plugin , MainClass , or the name of your plugin. The Plugin class must have a method with the PluginEntryPoint attribute. 4 parameters must be passed on to PluginEntryPoint attribute, in the following order: Plugin Name, Plugin Version, Plugin Author, and Plugin Description. If you are planning to use any kind of events, you would call EventManager::RegisterEvents in the PluginEntryPoint method, more on that in the EventHandlers section. Here is also where a Singleton would be initialized. ### The Config Class #### NOTE: The Config class isn't required, but is recommended since you will need to if you're planning on letting serverhosts make any changes to your plugin. You are encouraged to include any config values for things you (or other serverhosts) may want to change. The Config class contains properties, which values will be serialized and deserialized into/from a YML file when the plugin loads. Properties are similar to fields, except they have a getter and a setter. public string Text { get; set; } is an example property. Properties can be of any supported type, but they must be public. You can prevent properties from being serialized using the [YamlIgnore] attribute, this, however, will require the YamlDotNet package to be installed. Non-public properties and anything else that isn't a property will be ignored. You need to define your Config class in the Plugin class using the PluginConfig attribute, by adding it to a field with your Config class as type. This typicially looks like this: csharp [PluginConfig] public Config Config; You can access any values inside the config via its instance defined the the Plugin class. If you need to read values outside the Plugin class, consider making your Plugin a Singleton . ### Event Handlers An event handler is a method that are called when a specific event is triggered. An event handler is marked with the PluginEvent(EventType) attribute. Any class containing an event handler must be registered using EventManager.RegisterEvents<CLASSNAME>(this); in the PluginEntryPoint method. If the event handler is in the Plugin class, you can simply call EventManager.RegisterEvents(this); . Here is an example of an event handler which displays a welcome message: csharp [PluginEvent(ServerEventType.PlayerJoined)] public void OnPlayerJoin(Player player) { player.SendBroadcast(\"Welcome to the server!\", 5); }"
