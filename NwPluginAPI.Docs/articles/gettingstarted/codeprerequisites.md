# Plugin prerequisites
### The `Plugin` Class
> #### WARNING: Your plugin MUST have a `Plugin` class.
- The `Plugin` class is the main class of your plugin. It contains the entry point of your plugin and is used to initialize your plugin.
  - It is typically named either `Plugin`, `MainClass`, or the name of your plugin.
- The `Plugin` class must have a method with the `PluginEntryPoint` attribute.
  - 4 parameters must be passed on to `PluginEntryPoint` attribute, in the following order: <br>
    Plugin Name, Plugin Version, Plugin Author, and Plugin Description.
  - If you are planning to use any kind of events, you would call `EventManager::RegisterEvents` in the `PluginEntryPoint` method, more on that in the EventHandlers section.
  - Here is also where a ['Singleton'](https://csharpindepth.com/Articles/Singleton) would be initialized.
### The `Config` Class
> #### NOTE: The `Config` class isn't required, but is recommended since you will need to if you're planning on letting serverhosts make any changes to your plugin. Most developers will urge you to include as many config values as possible as this is considered good practice.
- The `Config` class contains properties, which values will be serialized and deserialized into/from a YML file when the plugin loads.
  - Properties are similar to fields, except they have a getter and a setter. <br> `public string Text { get; set; }` is an example property.
  - Properties can be of any supported type, but they must be public.
  - You can prevent properties from being serialized using the `[YamlIgnore]` attribute, this, however, will require the `YamlDotNet` package to be installed.
  - Non-public properties and anything else that isn't a property will be ignored.
- You need to define your `Config` class in the `Plugin` class using the `PluginConfig` attribute, by adding it to a field with your `Config` class as type. <br> This typicially looks like this: <br>
  ```csharp
  [PluginConfig]
  public Config Config;
  ```
- You can access any values inside the config via its instance defined the the `Plugin` class.
  - If you need to read values outside the `Plugin` class, consider making your `Plugin` a [Singleton](https://csharpindepth.com/Articles/Singleton).
### Event Handlers
- An event handler is a method that are called when a specific event is triggered.
- An event handler is marked with the `PluginEvent(EventType)` attribute.
- Any class containing an event handler must be registered using `EventManager.RegisterEvents<CLASSNAME>(this);` in the `PluginEntryPoint` method.
  - If the event handler is in the `Plugin` class, you can simply call `EventManager.RegisterEvents(this);`.
- Here is an example of an event handler which displays a welcome message:
  ```csharp
  [PluginEvent(ServerEventType.PlayerJoined)]
  public void OnPlayerJoin(Player player)
  {
      player.SendBroadcast("Welcome to the server!", 5);
  }
  ```
