# Making your first plugin
## Environment setup:
### [IDE](gettingstarted-ide.md) (Beginner-friendly)
* [Visual studio](gettingstarted-ide.md#visual-studio-walkthrough)
* [Jetbrains rider](gettingstarted-ide.md#rider-walkthrough)
### [CLI](gettingstarted-cli.md) (For people who can't run an IDE)

## Writing the code
Before we begin writing our code, we must make sure that we understand the [plugin prerequisites](codeprerequisites.md) so we can avoid and unnecessary errors.
